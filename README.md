# ToDo List app
A java ToDo list app.
This is my first hands on Java project. 

The goal is to ceate a todo list wich can :
 - Create tasks and store them in a file that can be loaded later.
 - Oranize task per priorities

Each task is composed of :
 - A title
 - A descrition
 - A date of creation
 - If the task is completed or no.
 - When completed, a date of completion.
 - A date of deadline
